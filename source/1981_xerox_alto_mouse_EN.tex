\title{1981 -- Xerox Alto Optical Mouse}

\selectlanguage{english}

In March 1973, Xerox Corporation announced the Xerox Alto computer, considered the first workstation (and the first personal computer), as well as the first computer equipped with a graphical user interface \cite{wiki}. The workstation also came with the first mass-produced mouse in the history of computers, the Xerox Alto Mouse (Fig. \ref{fig:XeroxAltoPic}). According to the quotes given in \cite{mouses}, those mice weren't too reliable, picking up dirt, getting gummed up and not controlling the cursor anymore. Alto user had to unplug the mouse when that happened, put it into the ``Dead Mice''  box, and grab a cleaned one from the 'Clean Mice' box.

The mousepad was paper, sold in packs of 25 sheets \cite{pad}. The pattern was a
hexagonal array of light dots in a dark field, and was absolutely usable being duplicated by a copier. The reconstructed pad can be seen on fig. \ref{fig:XeroxAltoPad}.

The name of the mouse “Alto Mouse” is highlighted on the upper side of the case with two triangular stylized mice in outlines and solid lines. The bottom side shows that this is an optical mouse (figure \ref{NecAltoTopAndBottom}), which largely repeats the external design solutions of the Mouse Systems mice of the same period and is intended for use with a special mirror pad \cite{photo}.

In terms of size, the manipulator is an optical cursor control device typical for the 80s (figure \ref{fig:NecAltoSize}).

\end{figure}

In terms of ergonomics, the exterior of the Alto Mouse has a strong industrial design. At the same time, a large number of corners and flat edges are partly compensated by rounded joints of the edges in the part of the body closest to the user and convex long buttons conveniently located within the reach of the fingers (figure \ref{fig:NecAltoHand}).

Xerox Alto Mouse has a DIN connector and belongs to the Bus Mouse category according to the connection interface. A feature of such mice is that the optocoupler signals are processed not by a chip in the mouse case, but by a special adapter in the computer system unit; therefore, this mouse is powered by the computer without a separate power supply, unlike many early optical models that were connected to the serial port of the IBM PC.

Mouse internals are shown on figure \ref{fig:NecAltoInside}. You can see the specially produced chip \cite{vlsi82} and other parts incorporated into the standard Xerox Alto mouse housing \cite{vlsi82}..
